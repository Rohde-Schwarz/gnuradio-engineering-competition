1. bbscrambler works now on a 64bit basis, so 8bit per xor operation
2. ldpc works on bitwise xor of bits,
    loop unrolling, read one input bit just once,
3. bit interleaver, use a lookup table instead of generic mapping
    hardcoded some things for specific code




Todo:
-make improvements generic for each code of a FECFRAME
-bch lookup table

Ideas:
-operate with packed bytes in bbheader, bbscrambler and bch code,
